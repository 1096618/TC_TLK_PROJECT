Problem: Create a program that copy, delete and clear set

Pseudo code:
1. Display current color set `colors = {"red" , "blue", "green"}`
2. Ask user if they want to make a copy of  the current color set 
3. Copy color set `colors_copy = colors.copy()`
4. Ask the user if they want to remove a random color
5. Pop a color from copy color set `colors_copy.pop()`
6. Ask the user if they want to clear a set
7. Clear the copy color set `colors_copy.clear()`
