Problem: Create a program that filter out duplicate word with unique word

Pseudo code:
1. Create a story.
2. Split the story into words.
3. Create an empty list for the new story.
4. Loop through each word in the list of words:
   - If the word hasn't been used before:
   - Add the word to the new list.
5. The new list now contains only unique words in order.
